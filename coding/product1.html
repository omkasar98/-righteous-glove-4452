                            If you’re looking for a quality baitcast reel, you’ve come to the right place. Bass Pro Shops has a great selection of casting reels to choose from, as the pros can tell you. This is where they shop!<br><br>
    
    Not all baitcasters are the same, though. They vary greatly in price and performance, from brand to brand and style to style. Before you plunk your hard-earned money down for one of these reels, you’ll need to consider a few important factors.<br><br>
    
    <span style="color: blue;">Brand</span><br><br>
    Bass Pro Shops carries all the best-known baitcasting reel brands, with extensive selections from Shimano, Daiwa, Lew’s, Abu Garcia, and many more. Look into a professional angler’s boat, and most likely, these are the names you’ll see.<br><br>
    
    But if you follow today’s major tournament telecasts, you’ll notice that a number of top pros have made the switch to using Johnny Morris baitcast gear. This is our own brand, developed with input from the experts and designed to deliver the best performance-to-price ratio in the industry. These reels are proven winners and, we believe, the best value you’ll find!<br><br>
    
    <span style="color: blue;">Species</span><br><br>
    Bass and baitcast reels go together like cake and ice cream. By design, these reels simply have the strength to handle the heavier lines and lures used in bass fishing. And by the same token, baitcasters are also the reel type of choice for anglers targeting muskie, striper, catfish, and other challenging freshwater species; these reels are used extensively in saltwater as well.<br><br>
    
    <span style="color: blue;">Features</span><br><br>
    Do you really need all those bells and whistles? Answer that question, and you’ll be much closer to narrowing down your choices. For instance, some baitcast reel frames and sideplates are made of metal such as aluminum or magnesium, for maximum strength or to reduce the overall weight; some feature graphite construction. Some are small and compact for easy “palming,” which is important for finesse tactics, while others may have full-sized round bodies – all the better for winching in large game fish.<br><br>
    
    Similar considerations apply to various baitcaster components: the spool, gears, casting brake, bearings, drag system, handle type, etc. Our descriptions often touch on the reasons behind the differences in features, so be sure to look at several similar models before making your final choice!<br><br>
