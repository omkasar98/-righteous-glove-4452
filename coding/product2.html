              <p id="details" class="li">
                If you’re looking for a quality baitcast reel, you’ve come to
                the right place. Bass Pro Shops has a great selection of casting
                reels to choose from, as the pros can tell you. This is where
                they shop!<br /><br />

                Not all baitcasters are the same, though. They vary greatly in
                price and performance, from brand to brand and style to style.
                Before you plunk your hard-earned money down for one of these
                reels, you’ll need to consider a few important factors.<br /><br />

                <span style="color: blue">Brand</span><br /><br />
                Bass Pro Shops carries all the best-known baitcasting reel
                brands, with extensive selections from Shimano, Daiwa, Lew’s,
                Abu Garcia, and many more. Look into a professional angler’s
                boat, and most likely, these are the names you’ll see.<br /><br />

                But if you follow today’s major tournament telecasts, you’ll
                notice that a number of top pros have made the switch to using
                Johnny Morris baitcast gear. This is our own brand, developed
                with input from the experts and designed to deliver the best
                performance-to-price ratio in the industry. These reels are
                proven winners and, we believe, the best value you’ll find!<br /><br />

                <span style="color: blue">Species</span><br /><br />
                Bass and baitcast reels go together like cake and ice cream. By
                design, these reels simply have the strength to handle the
                heavier lines and lures used in bass fishing. And by the same
                token, baitcasters are also the reel type of choice for anglers
                targeting muskie, striper, catfish, and other challenging
                freshwater species; these reels are used extensively in
                saltwater as well.<br /><br />

                <span style="color: blue">Features</span><br /><br />
                Do you really need all those bells and whistles? Answer that
                question, and you’ll be much closer to narrowing down your
                choices. For instance, some baitcast reel frames and sideplates
                are made of metal such as aluminum or magnesium, for maximum
                strength or to reduce the overall weight; some feature graphite
                construction. Some are small and compact for easy “palming,”
                which is important for finesse tactics, while others may have
                full-sized round bodies – all the better for winching in large
                game fish.<br /><br />

                Similar considerations apply to various baitcaster components:
                the spool, gears, casting brake, bearings, drag system, handle
                type, etc. Our descriptions often touch on the reasons behind
                the differences in features, so be sure to look at several
                similar models before making your final choice!<br /><br />

                <span style="color: blue">What is a baitcast reel?</span
                ><br /><br />
                A baitcast reel is a device for storing, dispensing, and
                retrieving fishing line while in the act of fishing. Mounted
                atop a fishing rod and spooled with line, the reel provides the
                means to cast a lure or bait (hence the name) to a given spot,
                retrieve the lure in such a way that a fish may attack it, and
                bring a fighting fish to hand.<br /><br />

                <span style="color: blue"
                  >What are baitcast reels used for?</span
                ><br /><br />
                Baitcast reels are recommended when the fishing situation calls
                for the use of heavier line and/or extremely fast lure
                retrieval. Baitcasters, such as those made by Shimano, Johnny
                Morris, Daiwa, and Abu Garcia, are universally preferred for
                bass fishing and when targeting larger predators.<br /><br />

                <span style="color: blue">How do baitcast reels work?</span
                ><br /><br />
                Baitcast reels have a thumb bar that disengages the spool when
                pressed, allowing the spool to spin freely during the act of
                casting. Some baitcasters are equipped with brake systems that
                apply light pressure to the spool as it spins, to help with
                accuracy and prevent overruns. Once the cast is complete, the
                handle is turned to reengage the spool and begin the
                retrieve.<br /><br />
                <span style="color: blue">How do I choose a baitcast reel?</span
                ><br /><br />
                There are many factors to consider when choosing a baitcast reel
                for fishing. Things to look at include the size and type that’s
                best for you; baitcasters also vary in their line capacity, gear
                ratios, braking systems, and bearing count.<br /><br />

                <span style="color: blue">How much are baitcast reels?</span
                ><br /><br />
                Seldom will you find a baitcast reel priced under $50 these
                days. However, if you shop wisely you can still find a
                dependable baitcaster, such as our MegaCast Baitcast Reel, at
                that price. Depending on your needs, you can spend well over
                $500 for a top-of-the-line reel, such as a Shimano Antares or
                Daiwa Steez.<br /><br />

                <span style="color: blue">What is the best baitcast reel?</span
                ><br /><br />
                The best baitcast reel for your situation is the one that
                balances nicely on the rod you’ve paired it with and performs
                the way you expect it to. Different anglers have different
                expectations, so take the time to compare. You might prefer a
                high-performance/high value reel such as the Johnny Morris
                Signature Series for bass fishing, while your friend might opt
                for a Lew’s Custom Inshore SLP reel for saltwater use. The
                bottom line: there are many great reels to choose from.<br /><br />
